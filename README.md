# üß© Crossword AI Solver

This project implements a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** solver to generate complete crossword puzzles using **backtracking search** with **arc consistency (AC-3)** and **variable/value heuristics**.

---

## üìñ Overview

The program uses two main Python files:

- **`crossword.py`** ‚Äì Defines the crossword puzzle structure and variables.  
  - `Variable`: Represents a single variable in the puzzle (position, direction, length).  
  - `Crossword`: Represents the puzzle itself (height, width, structure, vocabulary, variables, overlaps).  
  - Supports neighbor detection and overlap mapping between variables.

- **`generate.py`** ‚Äì Implements the AI to solve the crossword puzzle.  
  - `CrosswordCreator`: Contains methods to enforce constraints, select variables, order values, and backtrack to a solution.  
  - Functions to implement:
    - `enforce_node_consistency()`
    - `revise(x, y)`
    - `ac3(arcs=None)`
    - `assignment_complete(assignment)`
    - `consistent(assignment)`
    - `order_domain_values(var, assignment)`
    - `select_unassigned_variable(assignment)`
    - `backtrack(assignment)`

The solver works by:

1. Enforcing **node consistency** to satisfy unary constraints (length of words).  
2. Using **AC-3** to enforce **arc consistency** for binary constraints (overlaps).  
3. Applying **backtracking search** to assign words to variables while satisfying all constraints.  
4. Using heuristics:
   - Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)  
   - Degree heuristic  
   - Least Constraining Value (LCV)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crossword-ai.git
cd crossword-ai
```
2. Install dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Required for image output (optional): `Pillow`
3. Run the solver:
```python
python generate.py data/structure0.txt data/words0.txt
```
- Generates a solved crossword puzzle printed in the terminal or saved as an image.

## üß© Dependencies / Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pillow (optional, for saving images)
Example `requirements.txt`:
```python
Pillow>=9.0.0
```
## üí° Notes
- `CrosswordCreator` uses CSP techniques to efficiently generate solutions.
- Node consistency ensures words fit the variable length.
- Arc consistency ensures no conflicts on overlapping cells.
- Heuristics improve search efficiency:
  - MRV: Choose variable with fewest remaining valid words.
  - Degree: Break ties by selecting variable with most neighbors.
  - LCV: Choose word that eliminates the fewest options for neighbors.
